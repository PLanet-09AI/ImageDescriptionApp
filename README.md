Assignment Two: Utilising Microsoft Cognitive Services
Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of machine learning 
algorithms developed by Microsoft to solve problems using Artificial 
Intelligence (AI).

Cognitive Services democratize AI by packaging it into discrete 
components, making it easy for developers to integrate these 
capabilities into their applications. Developers can access these 
algorithms through standard REST calls over the Internet to the 
Cognitive Services APIs.

In this assignment, you will use the Computer Vision AI API to develop 
an application that allows the user to upload a photo and then describe 
what is in that photo in text on the screen
